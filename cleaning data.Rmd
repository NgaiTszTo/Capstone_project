## Cleaning datasets
1  Checking all datasets to make sure all the values are valid by typing anyNA(data$columns)

2  If there are any Null values, eliminating the entire rows if it's unreasonable.

3  Setting conditions on specific columns : Mileage <= 120000, Year: 2007-2017 to filter some data out;

4. checking if there are any outliers on each datasets or columnns.

5. Eliminating the outliers on each datasets

6. Merging datasets: car_list1, cardataset1, cost_to_maintain, newmfc and store into new variable: newdataset

7. Make sure the merging data does not have duplicate values by checking the Vin columns because each vehicle does have a specific Vin
